# CPU and Disk Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

A fully responsive, interactive web-based simulator that visualizes CPU and Disk scheduling algorithms.

# Supported Algorithm
## CPU Scheduling
- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SJF (Shortest Job First)
- LJF (Longest Job First)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin
## Disk Scheduling
- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
- SCAN (Elevator)
- LOOK

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Recharts
- **Routing**: React Router

## Features
- **Interactive Input Forms**: Enter process details, burst time, arrival time, priorities, time quantum, or disk requests dynamically.
- **Graphical Output**: Bar charts, Gantt charts, and line graphs for visual comparison of algorithms.
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Shows average waiting time, turnaround time, total seek time, and seek sequences.
- **Compare Algorithms**: Side-by-side performance comparison of all algorithms.
